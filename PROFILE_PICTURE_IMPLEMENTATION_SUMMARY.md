# Profile Picture Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. **Supabase Storage Setup**
- Created `profile-pictures` bucket in Supabase
- Applied Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
  - Users can upload/update/delete only their own pictures
  - Public read access for all profile pictures
  - File path pattern: `{user_id}/{timestamp}.{ext}`

### 2. **Database Schema**
- Added `profile_picture_url` column to `participants` table
- Created indexes for better query performance

### 3. **Storage Helper Functions** (`lib/storage.ts`)
- `uploadProfilePicture()` - Upload with validation (5MB max, image types only)
- `deleteProfilePicture()` - Remove old pictures
- `extractFilePathFromUrl()` - Parse storage URLs

### 4. **Profile Page** (`app/profile/page.tsx`)
- Large avatar display (132x132px) with upload/change/remove buttons
- Real-time image preview
- File validation (JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF, max 5MB)
- Loading state during upload
- Immediate database update on image change
- Updates localStorage and triggers navbar refresh

### 5. **Dashboard Header** (`components/dashboard-header.tsx`)
- **Fixed positioning** (`fixed top-0 left-0 right-0 z-50`)
- Fetches profile picture from database on mount
- Displays profile picture in:
  - Small avatar (32x32px) in navbar
  - Medium avatar (40x40px) in dropdown menu
- Listens for storage events to update in real-time
- **Account switching fix**: Fetches fresh data from database on every mount
- Clears all user data on logout including profile picture

### 6. **Login Page** (`app/login/page.tsx`)
- Fetches and stores profile picture on login
- Ensures correct profile picture for each account
- Clears old profile picture if user doesn't have one

### 7. **Fixed Layout System**
All dashboard pages now use fixed header and sidebar:
- Header: `fixed top-0` with height ~57px
- Sidebar: `fixed left-0 top-[57px]` with width 256px
- Content: `pt-[57px] md:ml-64` for proper spacing
- Smooth scrolling without layout shifts

## üîß Technical Details

### Storage Bucket Configuration
```
Name: profile-pictures
Public: Yes (read-only)
Max Size: 5MB
Allowed Types: image/jpeg, image/png, image/webp, image/gif
Path Structure: {user_id}/{timestamp}.{extension}
```

### Security Policies
```sql
-- Users can only manage their own pictures
bucket_id = 'profile-pictures' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]

-- Public can view all pictures
bucket_id = 'profile-pictures'
```

### Data Flow
1. **Upload**: Profile Page ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Database ‚Üí localStorage ‚Üí Event ‚Üí Header Update
2. **Login**: Database ‚Üí localStorage ‚Üí Header Display
3. **Logout**: Clear localStorage ‚Üí Supabase signOut ‚Üí Redirect

## üêõ Bug Fixes

### Account Switching Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: When switching accounts, the old user's profile picture would persist in the navbar.

**Solution**:
1. Dashboard header now fetches profile picture from database on mount (not just localStorage)
2. Login page fetches and stores correct profile picture for each user
3. Logout clears all user data including profile picture
4. Database is the source of truth, localStorage is just a cache

### Layout Overlap Issue - FIXED ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Content was overlapping with header and sidebar when scrolling.

**Solution**:
1. Changed header from `sticky` to `fixed` positioning
2. Changed sidebar from `sticky` to `fixed` positioning
3. Added proper spacing: `pt-[57px]` for header, `md:ml-64` for sidebar
4. Content now scrolls independently without overlapping
